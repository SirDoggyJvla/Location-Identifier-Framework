title=Location Identifier Framework
description=[h1]Description[/h1]
description=[b]Location Identifier Framework[/b] is a framework designed to help mods easily identify in-game world locations using coordinates. With LIF, you can retrieve structured and detailed information about any known map area, both vanilla and modded, by simply passing X and Y world coordinates.
description=
description=Please note that this is a [b]framework[/b], not a standalone mod. It’s intended to be used by other mods that require detailed data of a certain location.
description=
description=[h1]How It Works[/h1]
description=LIF maintains a curated list of map regions, including both vanilla zones and areas added by supported map mods. On game start, LIF detects which mods are active and dynamically loads only the relevant location entries.
description=
description=[h1]Usage Examples[/h1]
description=[code]
description=local LIF = require("LIF")
description=
description=-- Get location data from coordinates
description=local loc = LIF.getLocation(5420, 9450)
description=print(loc.shortName) -- Outputs: Dixie
description=
description=-- Get the current location of a player
description=local playerLoc = LIF.getPlayerLocation(player)
description=print(playerLoc.longName) -- Outputs: Dixie, KY
description=[/code]
description=
description=Each location entry includes:
description=[list]
description=[*] [b]longName[/b] – Full name of the location (e.g., "Dixie, KY")
description=[*] [b]shortName[/b] – Abbreviated name (e.g., "Dixie")
description=[*] [b]id[/b] – A lowercase ID key (e.g., "dixie")
description=[*] [b]mod[/b] – The mod ID that added the location. If the location is vanilla, it will return "Vanilla"
description=[*] [b]isVanilla[/b] – Boolean flag for vanilla locations
description=[*] [b]startX/endX/startY/endY[/b] – Bounding coordinates
